Implementing the decision tree with Information gain and variance impurity heuristics

Project Execution Instructions - 

1. Extract zip , place the training set , validation set and test set in the Assignment_submission folder and open the command prompt.

2. enter the command - python main.py <L> <K> \training_set.csv \validation_set.csv \test_set.csv <toPrint>

3. L can be any number for number of times pruning technique to be used, independent of one another.

4. K is max number of times node to be deleted in one pruning iteration.
